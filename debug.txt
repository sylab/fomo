Problem:
Need to debug dmcache_policy kernel module, so we need to capture the kernel crash stack information.

This information was for the creation of a VM, but could mostly be applied to the creation of a new real-world testing environment

Journey:
Ubuntu Trusty is 3.13 with backlogged updates from up to 3.15
When compiling dm-cache kernel module on Ubuntu Trusty 3.13, symbol dm_bm_flush is missing
This is because dm_bm_flush was added to the dm_block_manager in 3.14
Trying to compile the dm-persistent-data module leads to an error as the bio struct was also changed in 3.14
Trying to include the definition within dm-cache leads to duplicate definitions
Not including the definitions lead to the symbols missing
So neither compilation strategy worked
Installed 3.14 kernel
Tried to download 3.14 kernel using linux-$(uname -r), but was constantly given 3.13
Don't know what was going on, but nothing was working here

Movement to 3.14 kernel
At first I attempted a apt-get upgrade to see if I can update the kernel slowly, but was moved all the way to 4.4 as Trusty was LTS
Movement to Ubuntu Utopic 3.14
As Ubuntu Utopic is not an LTS, when doing apt-get update/install 404 errors and ign signs are plenty
We need to update the sources.list file to use old-releases instead
There was also something going on with systemd, so we installed a thing and that kinda got fixed
Downloaded the kernel version directly instead of getting trusty to try to avoid issues
Compiled and everything worked.

Steps:
Download Utopic 14.10
Edit /etc/apt/sources.list
- replace us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu with old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
- replace security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu with old-releases.ubuntu.com/ubuntu
sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev gcc make perl git systemd-sysv
apt-get source linux-image-$(uname -r)
sudo su
- insert Guest CD for VirtualBox
- mount /dev/sr0 /mnt
- bash /mnt/VBoxLinuxAdditions.run
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "examp13@fiu.edu"
- I couldn't get clipboard copy working, so instead I had to cp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub to a shared folder vm_shared
- Add ssh key to GitLab
git clone git@sylab-srv.cs.fiu.edu:slyon001/cache_nucleus.git
cd cache_nucleus
- cp -r ../linux-$(uname -r) linux
- cp linux_patches/* linux/drivers/md
- make
sudo vim /etc/default/grub
- edit GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="" to GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="console=ttyS0,9600"
sudo update-grub
Add 2 disks
- Identify the smaller one as SSD
Add Serial COM
- Activate COM1
- Output type of Raw File
-- I have it output to /tmp/com_(vm name)
